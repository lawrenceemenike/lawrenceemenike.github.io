# A Life changing experience

Yes, you read that right! As at the time of writing this, I finished the book Deeplearning for coders with fastai and pytorch and being honest, it completely changed my perpestive and who I am. For long I have wished to become a data scientist/ML engineer. This book has helped in given me the much needed direction, focus and calmness needed to approach this and explore further into the realms of AI and ML. I'm looking forward to completing projects and sharing my journey on each project. I will come back in a years time to read this to see how much I've grown and improved over the year.
